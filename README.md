# AI_FlappyBird
**Welcome to the tutorial!**

This tutorial involves making a simple game of flappy bird from scratch using Python and then using a neural network AI to master the game.

### 1.Programming the game
*We start coding the game using pygame library for python.*
  The co-ordinate axes is shown as below:![Alt Text](https://github.com/namantuli18/AI_FlappyBird/blob/master/img_1.jpg)

The game creates a notion in which the bird appears to move right.
But in reality, the bird keeps on jumping in it's fixed x position  while the base and pipes keep moving towards the left.

*Also,the rapid shift between the bird images creates a notion that the bird is flapping it's wings*

***The stock values of the starting x position and velocity constants used seemed to me as best suited.
Feel free to mess with these values as long as the bird flaps xD***

### 2.Training the neural network using NEAT
NEAT Overview
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks. For a detailed description of the algorithm, you should probably go read some of Stanleyâ€™s papers on his website.

Even if you just want to get the gist of the algorithm, reading at least a couple of the early NEAT papers is a good idea. Most of them are pretty short, and do a good job of explaining concepts (or at least pointing you to other references that will). The initial NEAT paper is only 6 pages long, and Section II should be enough if you just want a high-level overview.

In the current implementation of NEAT-Python, a population of individual genomes is maintained. Each genome contains two sets of genes that describe how to build an artificial neural network:

Node genes, each of which specifies a single neuron.
Connection genes, each of which specifies a single connection between neurons.

To evolve a solution to a problem, the user must provide a fitness function which computes a single real number indicating the quality of an individual genome: better ability to solve the problem means a higher score. The algorithm progresses through a user-specified number of generations, with each generation being produced by reproduction (either sexual or asexual) and mutation of the most fit individuals of the previous generation.

*The activation function chosen is tanhx*

As we move towards infinity on the x-axis, the more closer the value is to 1.

Similarly as we move left from 0, the value moves towards -1.

There are 2 types of incremental fitness values that we provide to a particular bird:

a. Existential Fitness-For each passing second,the fitness is incremented by 0.1*30=3

b. Monumental Fitness-For each toggled obstacle,the fitness increases by 5

The stock values of threshold,genomes etc are enlisted in the op.txt file.

**Feel free to change these values as and when required.**

Though,the model trained gives really exquisite results in the first/second generation itself.
